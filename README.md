# Pytorch-Polynomial-Regression

This repository contains a simple implementation of polynomial regression using PyTorch. The model is designed to approximate a 4th-degree polynomial function through batch gradient descent. This example showcases how to build features, define a target function, and train a linear model to fit the data.
